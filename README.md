# Flatten SF Further

Live: https://flattensf-expanded.vercel.app

This is Neal Shulman's expanded version of [Drew Edwards' Flatten SF](https://github.com/almostimplemented/flattensf). The original MIT code license and street/elevation attribution are preserved below.

The A-to-B route finder replaces the original `alpha = 200` cutoff with an explicit distance allowance: 0%, 25%, 50%, 100%, 200%, 300%, or **400% longer** (the default). 400% longer allows five times the shortest physical street distance. The search minimizes total uphill gain within that limit, using the existing quantized elevation graph. It does not minimize maximum slope, promise real-world accessibility, or force longer routes when a shorter one already minimizes climbing.

The Pareto search uses integer-exact climbing comparisons rather than accumulating a tolerance at intermediate nodes. It keeps its existing four-million-label safety limit; truncated searches are explicitly marked as best found so far. The displayed slider keeps at most 30 routes while retaining both endpoints. Share links include the distance allowance and old links remain readable.

Walking and biking both use physical distance for A-to-B routes. The comfort-weighted calm-streets option remains available for bike loops, whose behavior is unchanged.

## Local build and verification

- `npm ci` (no runtime packages are required)
- `npm run build` rebuilds `site/` from the source UI and the original packed graph, without needing to regenerate the full GIS dataset.
- `npm test` checks independent exhaustive routing ground truth, the exact 400% boundary, real San Francisco routes in both modes across every allowance, share-link/UI routing wiring, truncation reporting, and production source guards.
- Serve `site/` with any static HTTP server to use the route finder locally.

## Vercel deployment

`npm run deploy:production` rejects every branch except `main`, rejects uncommitted files, and compares HEAD to live `origin/main`. The Vercel production build independently verifies the supplied commit against the public repository's current `main`. Vercel Git deployments are enabled for `main` only. No routing API keys or backend service are required.

The original analysis pipeline and its README follow. Its published findings and screenshots describe the upstream project; they have not been regenerated for this fork.

# flattensf

**[flattensf.com](https://flattensf.com/)**: the flattest route between any
two places in San Francisco, and every route between it and the shortest.

Behind it, an analysis of the city's hidden network of relatively flat
streets: the routes that connect San Francisco's neighborhoods while
climbing as little as possible.

![San Francisco's low-elevation backbone](outputs/sf_flat_backbone.png)

San Francisco is famously hilly, but it is hilly in a *structured* way. Its
hills are separated by valleys, saddles and old dune flats, and those low
places join up into a network that is far more continuous than the city's
reputation suggests. This project models that network from authoritative
elevation and street data, routes across it under several competing
definitions of "flat", and then works out which streets the city's geography
forces low-gradient traffic onto.

**The central result: about 14% more walking buys about 39% less climbing.**
Averaged over all 1,260 ordered neighborhood pairs, the minimum-climbing
pedestrian route is only 14% longer than the shortest one, yet avoids 39% of
the ascent and drops the typical steepest pitch from 27% to 17%.

The full write-up is in **[`outputs/findings.md`](outputs/findings.md)**, and
the checks against known ground truth are in
**[`outputs/validation_report.md`](outputs/validation_report.md)**.

## The route finder

**Live: [flattensf.com](https://flattensf.com/)**

Type where you are and where you are going, then drag the slider from
**shortest** to **flattest** and watch the route change. The slider steps
through every route that no other route beats on both distance and
climbing, solved in your browser over the full street graph: sliding right
never shortens the route and never adds climbing. The numbers, the
elevation profile and the list of streets follow along, street names are
drawn on the route itself, and the faint lines are the other routes in the
family, so you can see where they agree and where they part.

On a bike, **prefer calm streets** (on by default) measures distance in
comfort rather than feet: a block with a protected lane or path from the
SFMTA bikeway network counts as 0.8 of its length, a quiet street as 1, a
busy arterial without a lane as 1.4 to 2. The climbing axis is untouched,
so the slider still runs from the shortest comfortable ride to the
flattest; on twenty everyday trips across the city it adds about 7% to
the distance ridden and takes the share on bare arterials from 29% to 1%.
Untick it and the shortest end is the genuine shortest path.

The **loop button** next to swap turns the trip into a run or ride that
starts and ends in the same place. The slider becomes the loop's length
(1 to 15 miles), and the page tries dozens of loops of about that length
in every direction: out to one, two or three turning points (always a
real intersection) and home by other streets, avoiding any street within
a block of the way out, and optionally an out-and-back in each direction
(the flattest way to a turnaround half the distance away, and back).
Loops that double back on themselves without being an out-and-back, or
are too thin to be a loop, are dropped, and the flattest of the rest is shown,
with how much less it climbs than a typical loop of the same length from
the same start. Out-and-backs are left out unless *Allow out and back*
is ticked; with it they win more often than not (the Embarcadero, the
Marina, the Great Highway).

**GPX** (next to *Copy link*) downloads the route on show as a GPX track
with elevation, which Strava's route builder, Garmin Connect, Komoot and
most running apps import. The *mi / km* switch at the top of the card
picks the units; the choice is kept on the device. The search takes well under a second; up to about 20
miles it finds a loop from anywhere in the city, beyond that the city
runs out.

![The route finder](outputs/screenshot_route_finder.png)

Place search is **offline**: street intersections ("24th & Mission"),
addresses ("1234 Valencia") and about 10,000 parks, landmarks, stations,
schools, shops and cafes are built into the page from the street graph and
Overture's places, addresses and base themes. No geocoding API, so no key
to leak and nothing to pay for. You can also click the map, or drag either
pin. "Copy link" gives a URL that reopens the exact trip.

The site is static: [`site/`](site/) holds the page, its CSS and JS, the
whole street graph as one 4.8 MB gzipped file and the hillshade as a PNG,
and GitHub Pages serves it as is. Loading it cold takes a couple of seconds
on a decent connection; after that every route is solved locally. The same
page is also written as one self-contained 6.8 MB file,
[`outputs/sf_flat_route_finder.html`](outputs/sf_flat_route_finder.html),
which opens straight from disk.

### The explorer

[`outputs/sf_flat_routes_map.html`](outputs/sf_flat_routes_map.html) is the
working view of the analysis: the network coloured by gradient, the
discovered corridors, passes, barriers and basins as toggleable layers, the
four objectives with live α/β/γ sliders, a Pareto readout, and the warped
city below. It is dense by design.

![The explorer](outputs/screenshot_interactive.png)

Here it is showing the flattest walking route from the Bayview to Golden Gate
Park: 7.67 miles and 353 ft of climbing, against 7.01 miles and 1,076 ft for
the shortest one. The red arcs are the streets steeper than 10% — they trace
the city's hills like contours — and the thick pale blue lines are the flat
corridors the analysis discovered. The route threads between them.

### The warped city

![San Francisco redrawn by climbing cost](outputs/screenshot_warped.png)

The map can also redraw the city so that distance on the page means
**climbing cost** rather than geography. Places separated by a ridge move
apart; places joined by a flat corridor pull together. Twin Peaks drifts
almost 5 km from where it sits, West of Twin Peaks 3 km, Glen Park 2 km, while
Bernal Heights and Nob Hill barely move: they are hilly, but they are hilly
*next to* the flats.

The deformation is driven by the same cost model as the routes, with one
knob: how many metres of walking a metre of climb is worth. At λ = 0 the
page shows plain network distance (even then the Bay and the park bend
things), λ = 1 is the balanced objective, and higher values make the hills
loom larger; keeping it modest is what stops the routes becoming absurd. A
morph slider runs the real city into the warped one.

Method: about 175 anchor intersections (every neighborhood's access point plus
a 1 km lattice snapped to routable nodes) get a full cost matrix from the
in-page router; stress majorisation (SMACOF, unit weights) lays them out so
page distance matches cost, starting from their true positions so the result
is the least deformation that fits; a Procrustes fit turns and scales the
layout back onto geography so north stays up; and a thin-plate spline through
the anchors' displacements carries every street vertex, neighborhood outline,
corridor and route along with it. The whole thing takes about three seconds
in the browser, so the weight can be changed live.

This was prompted by a friend's piece that redraws cities by travel time; the
idea of warping a city by a non-geographic metric is theirs, the metric and
the construction here are different.

## Headline findings

- **Two spines carry the city.** The Mission valley floor (Valencia–Guerrero–
  Market–16th, 6.9 km at 1.3% mean gradient) runs north–south; the
  Wiggle–Panhandle–Golden Gate Park chain (7.6 km) runs east–west. The
  analysis was not told either existed.
- **The Wiggle emerges unprompted.** Asked for a flat bicycle route from
  Market at Duboce to Haight at Masonic, the model returns the Wiggle. Both
  routes must gain the same unavoidable 47 m; the shortest one throws away a
  further 19.2 m of climbing getting there, the Wiggle only 5.9 m — for 0.4%
  more distance.
- **One pass dominates the city.** An unnamed path in Golden Gate Park at
  ~255 ft is the binding constraint for 119 of 630 neighborhood pairs — the
  lowest point on the ridge dividing the eastern flats from the ocean side.
  Crossing San Francisco east–west costs that 255 ft whatever you do.
- **Twin Peaks has no cheap way over it.** The lowest crossings into West of
  Twin Peaks and Diamond Heights are Lansdale Avenue (696 ft) and Panorama
  Drive (635 ft). These neighborhoods are the ones the flat network cannot
  reach.
- **Total climbing and peak steepness are different objectives.** The
  grade-averse route climbs *more* in total than the flattest route (325 ft
  vs 281 ft) while holding the steepest pitch to 10.8% instead of 17.2%. No
  single definition of "flat" serves both.

## Methodology

### Elevation

Elevation accuracy drives everything else, so the method is deliberate.

1. **Source.** USGS 3DEP **1 m bare-earth lidar**, project
   `CA_SanFrancisco_B23` — four cloud-optimised GeoTIFF tiles in
   EPSG:26910 (NAD83 / UTM 10N), which is also the CRS used for every length
   and slope computation. No raster reprojection is ever performed.
2. **Noise suppression, spatially.** A Gaussian filter of σ = 3 m is applied
   to the DEM before sampling. Bare-earth lidar still contains
   decimetre-scale artefacts from curbs, parked vehicles, vegetation
   misclassification and interpolation over occlusions. σ = 3 m is far
   narrower than a San Francisco street (15–25 m kerb to kerb) and far
   narrower than the ~100 m block scale on which real street gradient varies.
3. **Sampling at 5 m.** Chosen empirically. At 10 m spacing the short steep
   pitches that give the city its reputation were measurably clipped —
   Bradford Street read 36.8% against a documented 41%, Prentiss Street 32.9%
   against 37% — while sampling at 5 m returns 41.4% and 36.9% respectively
   before smoothing.
4. **Structures.** Where an edge is flagged `is_bridge` or `is_tunnel` the DEM
   describes the ground or water *under* the deck. Such edges get a linear
   ramp between their endpoints; endpoints that are themselves unreliable
   (mid-viaduct nodes) are recovered by solving a discrete Laplace problem
   over the structure sub-graph with the reliable nodes as boundary
   conditions — the deck is modelled as the smoothest ramp consistent with
   where it meets the ground.
5. **Smoothing per street segment, not per edge.** A Savitzky–Golay filter
   (order 2, ~50 m window) is applied to the *concatenated* profile of each
   contiguous run of a street segment. Smoothing edges in isolation gave the
   two edges either side of an intersection different elevations for the same
   corner, and in San Francisco that happens every 80 m.
6. **One elevation per intersection.** Each node is reconciled to a single
   elevation and every profile is rubber-sheeted onto it with a linear
   correction (0.02 m on average). This makes per-edge climbing sum *exactly*
   to the difference between a route's endpoints.
7. **Dead-band on cumulative gain.** Cumulative gain and loss are computed
   after pruning every elevation reversal smaller than 0.5 m. Pruning
   replaces a run by its **monotone envelope** clamped to the run's
   endpoints, so an oscillation below the dead-band contributes no gain at
   all, while a genuine sustained climb is preserved to the millimetre *and
   the shape within the run is preserved* — which is what makes per-edge
   figures additive along a route.

The last two points matter more than they sound. Two earlier
implementations were measurably wrong and are kept as regression tests: a
backlash-operator dead-band charged one dead-band per edge and lost 17 m of
real climbing on a route over Twin Peaks, and a linear-interpolation
rectifier redistributed climbing within a segment with errors reaching 51 m.

**Validation** (full report in
[`outputs/validation_report.md`](outputs/validation_report.md)):

- Against the independent USGS 1/3 arc-second DEM at 4,000 random points:
  mean difference −0.02 m, RMS 0.68 m, 98.5% within 2 m.
- Against documented street gradients: 6 of 8 within 5 percentage points
  (Filbert 32.9% vs 31.5%, 22nd Street 32.6% vs 31.5%, Jones 31.1% vs 29.0%,
  Prentiss 32.9% vs 37%, Baden 34.5% vs 32%, Duboce 28.8% vs 27.5%). Of the
  two that miss, Nevada Street is a *classification* issue — its published
  35% pitch is tagged `steps` in OpenStreetMap and measures 34.6% as a
  stairway — and Bradford Street is smoothing attenuation, discussed under
  Limitations. The model was not changed to fit either.
- The Embarcadero and the Great Highway, the city's two genuinely level
  corridors, come out at 1.07 and 1.16 m of climbing per km. Jones Street
  comes out at 39.5 m/km — a 37-fold separation.
- Internal invariants asserted in the test suite: per-edge
  `gain − loss == net_change` holds to 0.0 for all 175,552 directed edges,
  and no node has an inconsistent elevation.

**Sensitivity** (`python -m sf_flat_routes sensitivity`; tables in
[`outputs/sensitivity.md`](outputs/sensitivity.md)). The whole pipeline was
rebuilt under ten one-at-a-time changes to the elevation parameters (sample
spacing 2.5/10 m, smoothing window 12.5/50 m, dead-band 0.25/1 m, spatial
pre-filter 0/6 m) and to which intersection stands in for each neighborhood
(second- and third-nearest). The headline moves from +14% / 39% to at most
+15% / 40%; the dominant pass is the same Golden Gate Park crossing at 255 ft
in all eleven runs; the Wiggle wins in all eleven. The corridors are the least
rigid part: the street that qualifies as corridor material is 71–99% the same
by length, and 8–12 of the top twelve lead streets keep their place, but
where each corridor is cut, and so what it is called, shifts — most under the
smoothing window — and a handful of borderline streets (Market, Divisadero,
24th, Greenwich among them) drift in and out of the top twelve. They should be
read as a tier, not a ranking.

### Street network

Overture Maps' transportation theme (OpenStreetMap-derived, ODbL). Topology
comes from Overture **connectors**: every segment lists the connector IDs it
touches with the fractional position along its own geometry, so splitting at
those positions and keying nodes by connector ID gives exact topology with no
snapping tolerance, and grade-separated crossings correctly stay
unconnected.

Reading it is cheap despite the theme being ~64 GB: Parquet row-group
statistics on the `bbox` column mean only **7 of 16,384 global row groups**
intersect San Francisco, so the extract takes seconds and ~10 MB.

Access is derived from Overture `access_restrictions`, whose rule shapes in
San Francisco are `denied` + `heading=backward` (one-way, 7,034 segments),
per-mode `denied`/`allowed`/`designated`, and `as_private` /
`at_destination` conditional access. One-way is enforced for bicycles and
ignored for pedestrians, since OSM `oneway` describes vehicle movement;
contraflow bicycle lanes are honoured. A rule for a specific mode outranks
a rule for all modes: SF's Slow Streets carry "everyone: destination only"
alongside "foot: allowed, bicycle: designated", and reading the general
rule first had dropped 9.9 km of them from the walking and cycling graphs.

Two classification facts shaped the mode filters, both verified against the
data rather than assumed:

- `trunk` includes **Van Ness Avenue, 19th Avenue, Lombard Street and part of
  Mission Street** — ordinary surface streets with sidewalks. `trunk`
  therefore *cannot* be excluded from walking or cycling.
- `motorway` is true grade-separated freeway and is excluded.
- `steps` (2,652 edges, 35 km) is a real part of the pedestrian network and is
  **excluded outright for bicycles**. A route suitable for a pedestrian is
  emphatically not necessarily rideable.
- `sidewalk` and `crosswalk` subclasses are excluded for both modes: travel is
  modelled along street centrelines, because including the sidewalk network
  would represent every street two or three times and wreck corridor
  aggregation.

### Routing model

Edge cost, in "equivalent metres" — the distance a traveller would consider
as bad as this edge:

```
cost = length × mode_multiplier(class)
     + α × cumulative_gain
     + β × Σₖ penaltyₖ × distance_above_thresholdₖ
     + γ × extreme_extra × distance_above_highest_threshold
```

The threshold terms are **cumulative**: 100 m at 12% incurs the 3%, 5%, 8%
and 10% penalties simultaneously, so the marginal cost of steepness rises
super-linearly rather than staying flat. `α` is the substitution rate between
climbing and distance — Naismith's rule for walking implies about 8 m of flat
walking per metre climbed.

Only `cumulative_gain` ever enters the cost, never net elevation change. A
route that climbs 120 m and descends 120 m has zero net change and is not
flat; that is the analytical point of the project, and it is asserted in the
test suite.

Four objectives, all configured in [`sf_flat_routes/config.py`](sf_flat_routes/config.py):

| Objective | α | β | γ | Intent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `shortest` | 0 | 0 | 0 | distance only (comfort multipliers off, so it is a true baseline) |
| `min_climb` | 120 | 0 | 0 | near-lexicographic preference for avoiding ascent |
| `grade_averse` | 4 | 12 | 6 | steep *segments* dominate; total ascent secondary |
| `balanced` | 14 | 2 | 2 | flat but without absurd detours |

Bicycle costs additionally carry stress weights (protected cycleway 0.85,
19th Avenue and Van Ness 1.9) and respect one-way restrictions. These are
switched **off** for `shortest`, so that every distance-penalty and
elevation-saved figure is measured against a genuine shortest path. The
route finder's "prefer calm streets" uses a separate table that also knows
the SFMTA facility class of each block
([`bikeways.py`](sf_flat_routes/bikeways.py)).

### Corridor detection

A street earns corridor status by being *used*, repeatedly, by good flat
routes between different parts of the city, and by saving climbing when used.
For each edge the analysis accumulates, over every ordered neighborhood pair
and every climb-averse objective: the number of distinct pairs served, the
number of distinct neighborhoods at either end (which separates a citywide
corridor from a street busy between one pair of districts), and the climbing
avoided versus the shortest path, apportioned by the edge's share of route
length. Edges whose own gradient disqualifies them as flat are excluded
regardless of usage, so the unavoidable climbs *out* of a corridor do not get
absorbed into it. Contiguous high-scoring edges are then merged, short gaps
are closed, and the result is labelled by its constituent street names.

### Routing in the browser

Both pages ship the graph, not a set of answers. Earlier it carried
~10,000 precomputed routes, which meant it could only speak about the 36
neighborhood access points; embedding the graph itself turned out to be both
*smaller* and far more useful.

The packing is in [`sf_flat_routes/webgraph.py`](sf_flat_routes/webgraph.py):
69,864 nodes, 161,176 directed arcs, 87,776 edge geometries and the vector
overlays are quantised into typed arrays, concatenated into one buffer and
gzipped. The browser inflates it with `DecompressionStream` and takes
`TypedArray` views straight onto the result — no JSON number parsing. For
the route finder, 11.3 MB of arrays, geometry, places and addresses
compress to 4.8 MB, so the whole self-contained page is **6.9 MB and
interactive in under four seconds**, against 19.3 MB for the precomputed
version.

Routing is a Dijkstra over a CSR adjacency with a flat binary heap and a
visit-stamp array, so nothing is reallocated between searches. It settles a
cross-city route in **about 9 ms** (61 ms worst case observed), which is what
makes the weight sliders feel live. The cost function is a line-for-line
mirror of `routing.edge_costs`, including the per-class comfort multipliers
and the flag that disables them for the `shortest` objective.

The street network is painted directly onto a canvas from the packed arrays,
with viewport culling and a zoom-dependent minimum edge length. 88,000
individual Leaflet polylines would not have been usable; one canvas pass is.

The route finder's slider is a **family of routes**: the whole frontier of
distance against climbing between the two points, every route that no
other route beats on both counts, sorted from shortest to flattest. The
first version swept a weighted sum, *length + α × climbing*, over values
of α. That finds only the frontier's convex hull: a route that is a good
compromise but sits in a dent of the curve never wins for any α, and on
some trips the dent holds most of the interesting routes (California &
Kearny to the Marina jumped straight from the direct route over Russian
Hill to the Embarcadero loop, with nothing in between). The frontier is
now found by a bi-objective search, BOA* (bi-objective A* with lazy
dominance checks, Hernández et al. 2020): labels carry (length, climbing),
expand in order of bounded length, and a label is dropped on reaching a
node with no less climbing than a label that got there earlier, which by
the expansion order was also no longer. The bounds are exact reverse
Dijkstras on each objective; the search is capped at the length of the
flattest weighted route (α = 200, beyond which the router walks miles to
save a few feet) and the climbing of the shortest, and frontier points
within 0.5 m of climbing are merged. It takes 0.1–0.6 s in the browser for
trips across the city, during which the shortest route is already shown;
the slider then runs evenly over up to thirty routes spread along the
frontier. Along a frontier sorted by distance, climbing can only fall, so
sliding right never shortens the route and never adds climbing, which is
what the end labels promise. A genuinely continuous morph between two
street routes is not meaningful — a path halfway between Valencia and
Church Street runs through buildings — so the continuity is in the
trade-off, not the geometry.

Place search runs on an index packed into the page: intersections are
derived in the browser from the graph's own street names; parks, schools,
stations, piers, peaks and beaches come from Overture's base theme (mapped
OpenStreetMap outlines, which are reliable); landmarks, shops and cafes
come from Overture's places feed, which is not — the same name recurs at
several spots, some nowhere near the real thing — so a POI record is kept
only where neighbouring records corroborate it and is dropped when a
mapped feature already carries its name
([`sf_flat_routes/places.py`](sf_flat_routes/places.py)). Addresses are
230,000 (street, number) points in 10 bytes each.

### Passes and barriers

"How much climbing is unavoidable between these two parts of the city?" is a
**minimax (bottleneck) path** problem, not a shortest-path problem:

```
pass_height(s,t) = min over paths P from s to t of ( max elevation on P )
```

This has an exact solution. Sorting every edge by its crest and adding edges
to a union-find structure in increasing crest order builds a minimum
bottleneck spanning tree; the crest of the edge that first connects `s` to
`t` *is* `pass_height(s,t)`, and the lowest common ancestor in the resulting
merge tree answers every pair from one construction. The result was checked
against the routing: the maximum elevation reached on the minimum-climbing
route is at or above the computed pass height for **all 1,260 pairs, with
zero violations**.

Barriers are the complementary view: steep edges carrying heavy
shortest-path traffic. One that keeps its traffic under the climb-averse
objectives has no alternative; one that loses it does.

### Neighborhood access points

A polygon centroid can land in a park, on a cliff, in the water, or outside a
concave neighborhood entirely. Instead, each neighborhood's representative
point is the **street-length-weighted centre** of its network nodes — street
length being a far better proxy for where journeys start than polygon area —
snapped to the nearest qualifying intersection (degree ≥ 3, named street, of
an ordinary urban class). The offset from the geometric centroid is recorded
for audit: across both modes only two points exceed 400 m — Lakeshore at
453 m, because most of that neighborhood is Lake Merced, and the Presidio at
444 m for cycling, because its centroid sits in woodland off the rideable
network.

### Two substitutions, and why

`data.sfgov.org` and `sfgov.org` are **blocked by the build environment's
network egress policy**, so two datasets could not be fetched from their
authoritative source by the pipeline:

1. **Neighborhood boundaries.** The official 41-unit *Analysis Neighborhoods*
   product could not be downloaded. This project uses the long-standing
   37-unit San Francisco planning neighborhood set via the Code for America
   `click_that_hood` mirror — a real, widely used SF boundary set whose union
   is 122.0 km² against the city's ~121 km² land area. The two products
   differ mainly in how the Sunset, Richmond and Twin Peaks areas are
   subdivided, which affects representative-point placement but not the
   street model. The mirror does not state its boundary vintage.
2. **SFMTA bikeway network and Slow Streets.** The explorer's bicycle and
   low-stress layers are derived from Overture/OSM attributes
   (`class=cycleway`, `living_street`, `pedestrian`, bicycle-designated
   paths), which carry no SFMTA facility class. The route finder's bike
   comfort weighting is different: it uses the real SFMTA Bike Network,
   downloaded by hand to `data/raw/sfmta_bike_network.geojson` and matched
   to the street graph geometrically (`bikeways.py`: within 12 m and 25°,
   over at least half of an edge; about 580 of the network's 760 km land on
   routable edges, the rest being Presidio and park paths and one-way
   pairs). Slow Streets come through Overture's access rules instead.

Both substitutions are recorded in the dataset registry and flagged
`[SUBSTITUTED]` by `python -m sf_flat_routes sources`.

## Installation

Python 3.10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/almostimplemented/flattensf && cd flattensf
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt        # or: pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

The geospatial stack (GeoPandas, rasterio, pyproj, shapely, scipy, networkx,
pyarrow) installs from wheels; no system GDAL is required.

## Reproducing the analysis

```bash
python -m sf_flat_routes all            # everything, in order
```

Or stage by stage — each caches its output, so re-running is cheap:

```bash
python -m sf_flat_routes sources        # dataset provenance table
python -m sf_flat_routes download       # fetch and cache source data (~750 MB)
python -m sf_flat_routes build-network  # street graph, elevation, edge metrics
python -m sf_flat_routes analyze        # pairs, Pareto, corridors, passes
python -m sf_flat_routes validate       # checks against known ground truth
python -m sf_flat_routes map            # interactive + static maps, and site/
python -m sf_flat_routes report         # written analysis
```

### Deploying the route finder

`site/` is committed already built, because building it needs the cached
lidar and Overture data that CI does not have. The workflow in
[`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml) publishes that
directory to GitHub Pages on every push that touches it. One-time setup in
the repository: Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**, then under
Custom domain enter `www.flattensf.com` and tick "Enforce HTTPS" once the
certificate is issued. At the registrar, add a CNAME from `www` to
`almostimplemented.github.io`, and point the apex at GitHub Pages too
(A records 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153,
185.199.111.153) so that `flattensf.com` redirects to `www`. Any other
static host works the same way: upload `site/` and nothing else. The host
and the page URL used for the canonical link and the social-preview tags
are `SITE_DOMAIN` and `SITE_URL` in [`config.py`](sf_flat_routes/config.py);
the preview card itself is `site/preview.jpg`, a 1200×630 JPEG regenerated
by the screenshot step after every build.

Add `--force` to recompute a stage instead of using its cache. Ad-hoc
routing:

```bash
python -m sf_flat_routes route --from Mission --to "Outer Sunset"
python -m sf_flat_routes route --from "Inner Richmond" --to Downtown/Civic\ Center --mode bike
```

```
Mission  ->  Outer Sunset   [walk]
objective        miles  climb ft  loss ft  max %   >5% m   >8% m            vs shortest
shortest          5.10      1130      955   59.9    2677    1303
min_climb         6.22       333      158    9.2     211       1   +22% dist,   +797 ft climb
grade_averse      6.38       349      174    7.0       3       0   +25% dist,   +781 ft climb

```

A full clean run takes about **4.5 minutes** on 4 cores and completes with no
warnings at all: ~55 s to download and cache 725 MB of source data, ~1 m 40 s
to build the street graph and sample 1.6 M elevation points, ~30 s for the
routing analysis (10,080 routes), ~15 s to validate, and ~1 m 15 s to render
the maps. Re-running any stage from cache is near-instant.

### Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q             # 150 tests
```

Covering grade computation, cumulative elevation gain (dead-band behaviour,
additivity, exact directional symmetry), directional edge costs, the routing
cost model, access-rule interpretation, the minimax pass algorithm, corridor
scoring, payload quantisation and bundling, and hillshade/geometry helpers —
plus integration tests that assert the model's invariants against the real
processed data.

`tests/test_webmap.py` goes further and drives the built map in headless
Chromium, handing the JavaScript router the exact arc sequences Python chose.
It asserts that the browser's metrics match Python's on an identical path,
and that the route the browser finds for itself is never more expensive under
its own cost model. It skips itself unless Playwright, a Chromium build and a
built map are all present:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]" && playwright install chromium
python -m sf_flat_routes map && python -m pytest tests/test_webmap.py -q
```

```

Raw data is never written to; every expensive product is cached and
recomputed only with `--force`. Output is byte-reproducible: rebuilding the
maps and reports from the same cached data produces identical files, so the
repository does not churn on every run.

## Other cities

Nothing in the method is specific to San Francisco, but the code is
written for one city and has no city switch yet. Overture covers the
world, so the street network, places and addresses come for free; the
rest is a handful of settings and two or three local datasets:

- **Bounding box and projection** in [`config.py`](sf_flat_routes/config.py):
  `SF_BBOX`, and `CRS_PROJECTED`, the UTM zone of the city's lidar
  (Seattle is in the same zone as San Francisco, EPSG:26910).
- **Elevation** in [`sources.py`](sf_flat_routes/sources.py): the USGS
  3DEP 1 m project and tile names covering the city (`LIDAR_PROJECT`,
  `LIDAR_TILES`). Bare-earth lidar matters; a 10 m or 30 m DEM blurs
  street grades badly.
- **City boundary and neighborhoods** (`NEIGHBORHOOD_URL`): any polygon
  set works; it clips the network and seeds the analysis's access points.
- **Bike facilities** (optional): the city's own bikeway layer, mapped onto
  the facility codes in [`bikeways.py`](sf_flat_routes/bikeways.py). Without
  it bike mode falls back to road class.
- **Validation** ([`validate.py`](sf_flat_routes/validate.py)): the known
  steep and flat streets are San Francisco's and need local replacements,
  or the stage can be skipped.
- **Branding and the default trip**: `PRODUCT_NAME`, `SITE_DOMAIN` and
  `_DEFAULT_TRIP` in [`viz_interactive.py`](sf_flat_routes/viz_interactive.py).

Then run the pipeline above; the route finder in `site/` is static and
can be hosted anywhere.

## Limitations

Beyond the two dataset substitutions above:

- **Elevation is the ground, not the road surface.** Bridges and tunnels are
  interpolated; a handful of piers over water are solved from neighbours.
- **Travel is on street centrelines.** Pedestrian distances are block-scale,
  not door-to-door, and sidewalk-level detail is deliberately unused.
- **Maximum gradient on short edges is unreliable.** Over a 5 m stub a single
  decimetre of artefact reads as 20%; the worst real case found was a 5 m
  connector at Market and 5th reporting 41%. Edges under 15 m are flagged and
  excluded from maximum-gradient tests, which fall back to average gradient.
  41,330 of 87,776 edges are long enough to carry a reliable maximum.
- **One access point per neighborhood.** Large or awkward neighborhoods
  (Bayview, Lakeshore, the Presidio) are served worse than compact ones.
- **The route finder counts climbing, not steepness.** Its two axes are
  distance and total feet climbed, so 230 ft at 25% and 250 ft at 13% look
  almost the same. From Market & Taylor to the top of Nob Hill, straight up
  Taylor (0.48 mi, 229 ft, 25% at worst) beats Polk and California (1.39 mi,
  251 ft, 13% at worst) on both axes, so the gentler ride never appears on
  the slider. A steepness-weighted climbing cost is the planned fix.
- **No traffic, signals, surface quality or safety.** The bicycle comfort
  weights are a table over road class and SFMTA facility class, not a
  level-of-traffic-stress model: a painted lane on a six-lane arterial
  scores the same as one on a two-lane street.
- **Gradients are attenuated at the extremes.** Published "steepest street"
  figures are measured over the single steepest pitch, sometimes only 15–20 m
  long, and the smoothing chain costs roughly eight percentage points there.
  Bradford Street shows the whole chain: 41.4% sampled raw at 5 m against a
  published 41%, 36.8% raw at 10 m, 36.9% with the 50 m window applied within
  the edge, and 33.1% as the pipeline computes it (smoothed across whole
  segments and reconciled at intersections). The trade is deliberate: with
  less smoothing, lidar artefacts pushed 22nd Street and Baden Street to the
  60% plausibility ceiling. For a project about *flat* routes, clipping the
  peak of a 41% wall is a much cheaper error than inventing gradient on flat
  ground.
- **The place search is only as good as its sources.** Intersections and
  addresses are solid; Overture's places feed puts some well-known names in
  the wrong place, and the corroboration rules in `places.py` remove the
  worst of it rather than all of it. Check the pin.
- **The web pages quantise the graph** to keep the file small:
  lengths and steep distances to 5 cm, climbing to 1 cm, gradients to 0.01%.
  Route totals therefore drift from the Python figures by a few tens of
  centimetres over a long route, and where two routes tie on cost the browser
  may pick the other one. `tests/test_webmap.py` asserts both that the
  browser's metrics match Python's on an identical path and that its own
  route is never more expensive.
- **Treasure Island / Yerba Buena Island** are excluded from pair routing:
  they are part of San Francisco but have no pedestrian access across the
  western span of the Bay Bridge.
